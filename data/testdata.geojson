Birds seen and heard in the peri dawn hours today include: geese, dove, crows/blackbirds, songbirds, woodpecker, hawks. The recent rainstorm resulted in redistribution of curbside matter including pine straw, drink containers and leaves. Some grates were 80 to 95% obstructed with 6 inch high accumulations of fresh pine straw. Two typical pine straw samples measured 6 to 7.5 inches long, terminal dark colored hub measured 0.5 inches long. The straw appeared crayola \"burnt sienna\", \"tan\", \"tumbleweed\", \"desert sand\" colored and did not have a strong odor of decomposition or decay. Crickets chirping at slightly different tempos and pitches were abundant this morning. // There were no signs of wind damage or flooding, but there were some curbside piles of tree limbs and branches cut, broken, or sawed from weekend yard work. Yesterday I observed 5 to 10 yards using sprinklers prior to 5 AM. This morning, on a different route, there were two yards using sprinklers after 6 AM. edit 8:30 PM water quality..the faucet mounted water filter was changed today pursuant to the color coded change indicator after approximately 100 gallons filtered. Using color coded qualitative test strips for swimming pools, water was sampled and tested from the old filter, the new filter and another unfiltered faucet. The dry, new filter weighed 5 ounces, the old filter weighed 8.7 ounces (wet). Weight of old used filter will be repeated after >48 hours drying time to estimate particulate removed from tap water. Results of tests in order 1) used filter 2) new filter and 3) unfiltered residential water 8/28/2016 evening. HARDNESS: very low, very low & very low CHLORINE: ideal, low, & ideal to high. FREE CHLORINE: low, low & low. pH: 7.0 +/- 0.2, >8.4 & 7.0 +/-0.2. ALKALINITY: very low to low, low to OK, & low to OK. comments: the filter is meant to improve drinking water in far more ways than this simple qualitative test. This test does demonstrate that there are significant differences between residential tap water from a new filter, an old filter, and unfiltered outlets, most notable in the pH and chlorine categories. These simple results do not attempt to argue a better or worse water supply or quality, but demonstrate arguably different water supply and quality on different days/times with and without new and used filters.   \r\n\r\nDrought Impact Data: \r\nStartDate: 2016-08-28\r\nEndDate: NA\r\nIs Condition Monitoring Report\r\nCategories: \r\nBusiness and Industry\r\nPlants and Wildlife\r\nWater Supply and Quality","scalebar":"NA","stationname":"Morrisville 1.5 SSW","stationnumber":"NC-WK-185","reportdate":"2016-08-28T00:00:00Z","datetimestamp":"2016-08-28T04:36:53Z","creationdate":"2016-08-28T20:41:24Z"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.232407,35.141027]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":308,"categories":"","description":"weekly report.

However, generally no heating or a/c was necessary most of the week - so energy usage should be low for most.\r\nFIRE: no burn permits as the ground is wet - however, winter-dead grass could present a fire threat - until we receive more rain - which is expected within hours and throughout this next week.

I have talked to many construction people who have been unable to work by both. My husband works as an HVAC Technician, elderly people with old AC units are having them break right and left. These folks are in there 60-90s and can not take the heat either. I don't know if AC has helped us over the years as our bodies are not accustom to lack of cooling, coupled with people do not know how to stay hydrated. This is amazing for me, I grew up in the very very south end of Texas. We would get 115 close to the Gulf Coast and humidity would be out of this world. As an Epidemiologist and Public Health nurse I find this amazing. I researched some articals to try and find the name and recipe for the World Health Organization - Oral Rehydration Salts, that you put in water and it helps with hyrdation. Well, no one up to Bethesda at the National Instatutes of Health or the corrisponding agency working out of Baylor University in Houston Tx had never heard of the stuff. I found it, One packet makes 1 liter of water for rehydration in third world countries. I have been usuing pediolyte with my husband as he has had heat stroke once already last year on a tar roof fixing a commercial airconditioner. But someone needs to recommend this stuff to the public with in the US. I don't work anymore or I would (Retired Medicare Consultant here.) But the American Red Cross just says stay hydrated. But you drink too much water your electrolytes become thinned out and you have hyponatremia. This is serious! This out door healthy workers need to stay healthy, I found out in Houston/Glaviston area due to flood this year, they have roofers colapsing on roofs from heat exhaustion. The rehydration salts will work! We use it for diarrehial diseases, vomiting and other things like Cholera as oral rehydration is better then IV. The gut can take more fluid. But I am not a nutritionist, nor am I high enough in public office to effectively get this message out. But I was shocked the Military is not using this stuff in the Middle East and we are not using it in the US, but Africa anywhere knows about it. This stuff is sold in the US on line for 50 packet s only cost 34.99 but you can go on line with a gram scale and make this stuff from supplies at any health food store. YOU CAN NOT USE SPORTS DRINKS THEY HAVE TOO MUCH SUGAR/GLUCOSE which makes dehydration worse. Just staying. Crops and everything is suffering the effects, but these lighting strikes too, in this rural area is pulling down phones, power lines and taking out trees. I don't know what to say.

Rain came on a Friday in the area, but at this specific locale - not a drop. So VEGETATION, mostly annuals, were very much in a state of stress at the end of that week.  Some loss of plants occurred ( squash, annual flowers etc.); AGRICULTURE: soy beans that were planted at \"just the right time\" are flourishing - but any that were planted late remained small and were hurt by that first week of heat.  The second week we saw rain well spaced out that benefitted plant growth.  **  I have to note here that lately, forecasting has been really inaccurate - timing of rain(storms or otherwise ) as well as anticipated precipitation has not been as predicted.**  \r\nVegetables in OUR garden that are producing now are: tomatoes; green beans; cukes; cantaloupes.  Worth noting that peppers are beginning to flower again in the second week - the first week was just too hot, small peppers just wilted and fell off the plants. \r\nCLOVER is all but disappeared at this point / crepe myrtles and mimosa are blooming.  Soy locally is not flowering as of yet.  Honeybees are still bringing in nectar, but pollen levels are decreasing at this point.// Lawn and field grass needs continuous mowing to keep under control ( we always try to stay ahead of this, so that if a tropical storm comes we are ready  for it // Barn swallows are amazingly on their third batch of babies.  We are pleased to see an increase in the blue jay population - adults are visiting feeders and taking it back to their squeaking brood / hummers population is up now, and so are their visits to the feeders ( they had all but stopped visiting feeders for about 2-3 weeks ); the first week had birds looking for water - the second week not so much.

The stagnant water color at Grace Park near Alemany Drive appeared olive green with some redder brick colored tints near shallower sandbars. The was wind creating small pond surface ripples. The wind direction of the small puffy mid-level clouds was markedly different than the apparent water surface wind direction.

Surface debris was moving about 6 feet downstream in 20 seconds. I submerged a paper coffee filter supported by a kitchen strainer for 120 seconds. Although no debris was visible with the naked eye, many (more than 15 less than 30) small dark particles were visible with the aid of a handheld magnifying glass. The particle size could not be measured with the tape measure because of the small size.

During April, this area was observed to range from dry and flow less, to trickling,  to overflowing and gushing. The bottom was visible in the shade and overcast conditions. Water surface temperature was 64 degrees at this spot. Plant life on the ditch bank included mature flowering 3 leaf clovers, tall (>4 feet tall)wildflowers with slim white petals of ~1 inch length encircling a round yellow middle, dark green moss on the banks with stems measuring 1/2 inch long, and some mature trees. I removed one large stone from underwater that was partially buried in the grey/brown dark sandy bottom. The rock measured 12 inches long, 5 inches wide and 4 inches thick. There were no signs on invertebrate life or other life (algae, moss, etc) on the rock. The colors were mostly greys with relatively clear and straight lines of color demarcation. One area of dark green was on the rock but it was not slippery to the touch or otherwise representative of viable plant life at that time. In the park and the park parking lot corners, there were several areas of standing water measuring 1 to 3 inches deep. I recently observed a gallon of regular gasoline advertised at $2.19 9/10 per gallon. There was very light rain/mist at the time of of ditch observations. {{edit same afternoon 5/3/16}}: A cluster of 7 berry trees was observed by the ditch near this site. The eye level circumferences of the more than 6 tree trunks measured from 14 inches to 25 inches. Bright red and black or purple/blue berries were observed on the tree from eye level up toward the treetop more than 30 feet high. The berries appear like the common blackberry seen in markets in the produce section. Using a blind over shoulder toss of a metallic ring with 8 inch diameter, I counted berries within the area of the circle where it fell. Toss #1) 7 berries. Toss #2) 11 berries. Toss #3) 10 berries and toss #4) one berry fragment. The berries measured 1/2 to 1 inch long. Some were partially decomposed, but all were moist (lack of drought conditions). As a control, I walked across the street toward magnetic north and tossed the ring four times over the shoulder and did not encircle any berries. Other plant matter on the ground included sweet gum balls and pine cones. The aforementioned airborne white filamentous snowflake appearing floating plant matter was observed drifting with the gentle breeze at his site. \r\n\r\nDrought Impact Data: \r\nStartDate: 2016-05-03\r\nEndDate: NA\r\nIs Condition Monitoring Report\r\nCategories: Energy\r\nPlants and Wildlife\r\nWater Supply and Quality","scalebar":"NA","stationname":"Morrisville 1.5 SSW","stationnumber":"NC-WK-185","reportdate":"2016-05-03T00:00:00Z","datetimestamp":"2016-05-03T07:24:02Z","creationdate":"2016-05-03T16:11:21Z"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-78.931,35.9914]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":284,"categories":"","description":"Still very ample soil moisture at all levels.

Ran across at the junction of Indian Creek Road where Baum Rd runs into it, the inside corner (sharp 90 degree 20mph curve) has a swamp running up next to it. The area got compacted  down into the swamp area and the water was undermining this patch of road. The asphalt was going to crumble This imbankment is poorly designed as there is not any larger boulders and mesh to reinforce it going into a swamp/marsh. I don't know who deep the march/swamp is but it is vast. The shoulder is not even 6-8 inches so it is imperative they maintain this curve to prevent crumbling and rebuilding, accidents and potential loss of life. Farm combines, buses and semis have to get up and down certain back road. As I said my son is a building foundation/asphault/soil labratory tech/concreate civil enginer... and now the project manager for his company that is charged with building the new NASA Station. I consulted him on some of these issues a couple of days ago... He stated their is a fundamental error in how these roads are being made cause they should not have all the failing of pot holes and sliding. NE-NC would do good to consult some civil engineers from the mountains areas of the Smokes in this state... and VA would do good to do the same. Just my thought for a prevention strategy start. There are things they need to have those engineers reevaluate. (This eastern area of NC and VA has a Univ that teaches engineering, and it could be a project for the students to help with.

Hopefully, we will get some relief later this week from the tropical depression going into the Gulf of Mexico.\r\n\r\nDrought Impact Data: \r\nStartDate: 2016-08-29\r\nEndDate: NA\r\nIs Condition Monitoring Report\r\nCategories: ","scalebar":"NA","stationname":"Bluffton 6.2 WNW","stationnumber":"SC-BF-10","reportdate":"2016-08-29T00:00:00Z","datetimestamp":"2016-08-29T05:20:24Z","creationdate":"2016-08-29T08:20:23Z"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-78.845855,35.814159]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":5,"categories":"Energy,Plants And Wildlife,Society And Public Health,Tourism And Recreation,Water Supply And Quality","description":"This morning between 4 and 7 AM, I observed 4 juvenile frogs on the sidewalk, two large nearly dead or dead insects that make clicking sounds. The winged bugs measured 1.5 inches anterior to posterior thoracic segment with wings extending an additional 0.5 inch for a total lentgh of 2 inches. The undersides were mostly bright white. There were narrow green streaks bilaterally where the wings attach to the thoracic segments. I saw one bat circling a streetlamp near the creek. I saw and heard three hawks on the ground and in flight. I saw two separate areas, > 1 mile apart, where 3 or more modern streetlamps were not on and coincidentally or causative also had very wet sidewalks, obstructed curbside storm drain grates, and automated water lawn sprinklers. These issues affect the supply/demand/maintenance/repair of all who utilize or pay for utility services ($). I saw more than 10 people walking/jogging/cycling in the morning darkness, although some may have been the same people making rounds around the block, it is difficult to discern in the dark. (recreational sidewalk usage during day and night is the point) . The creek water appears quite stagnant this morning with a dull film or sheen that was previously noted and continues to increase in size due to lack of recent creek flow to wash or rinse the organic sheen of unknown origin (leaf decay/spill/decomposing deceased animal/seepage from underground/other), downstream.edited 8/28/2016 afternoon:: today this sheen and film is completely washed away, apparently by the thunderstorms of last night. The water is shallow, clear and slowly flowing. Less than 20 small minnows (<2 inches long, multi colored) were observed treading water without making headway up or downstream. A large rectangular piece of trash resembling a cooler box top (~2 to 4 square feet area) is washed up on a sandbar.   PLANTS: although much of the foliage remains green, a particular type of tree in a residential yard was observed today to have freshly fallen, brown, dry, crispy, brittle leaves. The tree circumference measures 28 inches and 29 inches at eye level. One larger ground level trunk splits into the two smaller trunks. The tree is approximately as tall as the one story residence rooftop apex is high. A representative leaf measured 3 inches long, was teardrop shaped, 2.5 inches wide at the widest and had a stem one inch long. Best crayola color match was \"tan\" on one side and \"tumbleweed\" on the obverse side. (many are smaller, a few are larger). I tossed a ring of 8 inch inner diameter (a stove top burner ring) six times from over/behind my shoulder while near the trunk and counted the dry leaves within the ring. RESULTS: 17 leaves;77 leaves;24 leaves;26 leaves;16 leaves and 19 leaves. The tree bark is a paper thin type and partially peeled from the tree trunk. Even in the few minutes I was counting leaves the gentle breeze caused a few leaves to fall in sight during the count at around 10 AM. \r\n\r\nDrought Impact Data: \r\nStartDate: 2016-08-23\r\nEndDate: NA\r\nIs Condition Monitoring Report\r\nCategories: Energy\r\nPlants and Wildlife\r\nSociety and Public Health\r\nTourism and Recreation\r\nWater Supply and Quality","scalebar":"NA","stationname":"Morrisville 1.5 SSW","stationnumber":"NC-WK-185","reportdate":"2016-08-28T00:00:00Z","datetimestamp":"2016-08-23T05:15:28Z","creationdate":"2016-08-28T13:42:27Z"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-79.157921,36.46433]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":19,"categories":"","description":"Nothing much has changed.

The animals made loud, short duration, unusual sounds (not a bark or a howl, more like short hisses or grunts) at me and my dog as they travelled through the parking lot into the nearby woods. Coloration of the mammals was not discernable under the distance and light conditions. I saw ~ 8 adult mallards and <8 mallard ducklings in the water in Grace Park. I have seen a few slugs and moist slug trails on residential door structures in the morning. One slug measured ~ 2 inches long and had two antennae that varied in length with retractions and extensions as the animal slowly moved vertically upon the building structure.  I saw two herons in flight at low altitude (below streetlight level) yesterday evening.  When commuting on bike in rural areas before sunrise, I see pairs of eyes along field and wood edges on a daily basis with the aid of small battery powered handheld lights. Some are deer, others are assumed to be stray cats or other animals that have not shown outward aggression towards me. Occasionally a domestic dog will bark from their land as the bike approaches.  I continue to hear mourning dove calling and woodpeckers pecking but have not seen as many geese in recent weeks.

After submerging the coffee filter/kitchen strainer for 2 minutes, some standing water remained in the bowl shaped filter and drained more slowly than usual. (sometimes it is empty when brought out of the water). I scraped a small amount of bottom substrate from a few inches below the surface. The material, at this particular location, was slippery between the fingers, grey colored, clay like, with some small red rusty colored streaks. With the aid of a digital camera and laptop computer, I was able to enlarge photos of the small particles captured in the 2 minute immersion of the coffee filter. The irregular shaped particles are large enough to count the rectangular pixels on the laptop screen when enlarged, but too small to measure with the available tools. Several small mosquitoes were observed at this creek site just above the water surface. The sky was overcast and a few very light misty raindrops fell during the hour. \r\n\r\nDrought Impact Data: \r\nStartDate: 2016-05-01\r\nEndDate: NA\r\nIs Condition Monitoring Report\r\nCategories: \r\nBusiness and Industry\r\nPlants and Wildlife\r\nWater Supply and Quality","scalebar":"NA","stationname":"Morrisville 1.5 SSW","stationnumber":"NC-WK-185","reportdate":"2016-05-01T00:00:00Z","datetimestamp":"2016-05-01T06:59:18Z","creationdate":"2016-05-01T10:03:09Z"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.232407,35.141027]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":282,"categories":"Agriculture,Business And Industry,Energy,Fire,Plants And Wildlife,Relief Response,Society And Public Health,Tourism And Recreation,Water Supply And Quality","description":"weekly : in eight days, we have had accumulation of 1.19 inches of rain.

What remains blooming here on out, will depend upon if we have frosts/freezes over the next two nights.\r\nGround moisture remains fairly high, and there is still some standing water in ditches.\r\nPESTS / INSECTS:  over the past week, both fire ants and mosquitos were truly annoying.  This is likely the worst mosquitos have been in nearly 10 years ( and fall is always worse than any other time of year ).  The fire ants have been fairly significant as well.  Both due to the rains we rec'd for weeks over the past month.\r\nNo public events have been impacted locally by weather this past week.\r\nAgriculture:  Soy beans are browned and drying - awaiting harvest.  \r\nEnergy:  temperatures have been such that neither a/c nor heating has been required most days over the past week.\r\nBLOOMING:  eleaganus, vitez, some magnolia, groundsel, asters, mums, roses.  Done blooming is golden rod.\r\nBIRDS:  have not seen blue jays, canary finches.  Still prevalent are cardinals, common house finches, wrens, mockingbirds, kill deer, doves.\r\nFOX scat is frequently seen.  Snakes have not been seen THIS past week.\r\nWater levels in our two major rivers remains a big higher than normal ( always wind driven \"tides\" here ).

For example - in our county, there is a flood warning for a nearby ( significant ) creek. The area that they are warning for is approximately 6 miles from our reporting location.  The effect on the location itself is that roadside ditches and lesser creeks are not draining quickly.  But there is not any roadway flooding overall. Areas that historically flood - likely have, but most have drained by the time ( Sun am ) of this report.\r\nWe are all very thankful that the hurricane did not make landfall.  However, time was spent preparing for that possibility. ( boat secured, yard items stowed or tied down etc.)  One cannot wait till a determination of a hurricane path to prepare.\r\nAGRICULTURE:  We traveled a couple hundred miles west into the middle of NC this Saturday. Tobacco still standing is likely \"lost\"; but soy beans locally and otherwise will probably still be able to be harvested.  Most corn has already been harvested.  I did not note cotton, but the heavy rains has likely damaged that crop, as it would most likely not have been harvested as of yet.\r\nTHE HAW RIVER was most definitely FLOODING.\r\nAs we left in the morning -the areas up river on the Neuse were rushing - by the time we returned in late afternoon - they were definitely flooding.\r\nOUTDOOR PUBLIC EVENTS:  Many were cancelled.  This is a time of county fairs.  One major Seafood event at the coast was NOT cancelled ( surprisingly ), and lucked out as the area did not receive the rains it might have on Saturday ( and is looking like Sunday may \"squeak by\" without significant rainfall. \r\nWINDS ARE VERY HIGH at the moment.  So the danger of power outages caused by falling trees - due to saturated soil - is still fairly high.\r\nIn the meantime: Autumn marches on.  Last lonely female hummer left - last day seen was Wednesday Sept. 30th.\r\nIn advance of the storm fronts, cardinals were feeding more actively than normal.  Crows an hawks have been quite vocal of late.  Wild turkeys are seen frequently in large groups.   \r\nMOWING Of LAWNs: has been impossible as there is either standing water, or the ground is so saturated that when walked upon, water comes near shoe tops.  Leaves are falling from oak, and crepe myrtle.  Red Maples are turning colors.  \r\nBLOOMING: Eleagnus / Vitez / Golden Rod ( got pretty beaten down by rains ).\r\nBEEKEEPERS: either harvested early last week ( and did winter-equipment on hives ) OR they will have to wait till the end of this coming week when wind and rains have abated and temperatures are still high enough to open the hives.  It is anticipated that with this duration of not being able to forage -bees will have been eating their stores - so less honey may be extracted than might have previously been anticipated.\r\n\r\nDrought Impact Data: \r\nStartDate: 2015-10-04\r\nEndDate: NA\r\nIs Condition Monitoring Report\r\nCategories: \r\nAgriculture\r\nBusiness and IndustryEnergy\r\nPlants and Wildlife\r\nSociety and Public Health\r\nTourism and Recreation","scalebar":"NA","stationname":"New Bern 8.8 W","stationnumber":"NC-CN-31","reportdate":"2015-10-04T00:00:00Z","datetimestamp":"2015-10-04T05:53:52Z","creationdate":"2015-10-04T08:57:16Z"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.878978,36.037254]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":585,"categories":"Water Supply And Quality","description":"The creek ( Flat Rock Branch) is flowing but low.

More was forecasted, but did not materialize.  There were three days with rainfall.  Winds were on the higher side, so drying was an effect.\r\nGround Water at the beginning of the week was at about 18 inches.  WATER TABLE: We had to dig a hole at the beginning of the week, and water sucked into it.\r\nNeuse River water level seemed low; but is important to realize that it is tidal, but wind driven. \r\nBIRDS:  Hummingbird: A male showed up early on Sunday morning April 5th.  By the end of the day, there were two at the feeder that was quickly placed.  At the end of the week, only these two males are evident.  Canary finches are now at the feeders.  A blue jay was seen, and the bluebirds are more actively foraging.  Still seen - cardinals, a variety of finches ( mostly common house finch ), red-winged blackbirds, cowbirds, crows, mockingbirds, robins, and wild turkeys are foraging ( and mating  - and hunting season opened here on April 11th ).\r\nAGRICULTURALLY , we have seen little activity.  There has been some preparation in the pine farm to replant after the heavy logging throughout the fall and winter. They have mounded up the rows to plant in.\r\nNEWLY BLOOMING PLANTS include Carolina jessamine, wild wisteria, cherry trees, azaleas are just starting HERE, snowball viburum is mid-bloom.  Done blooming: crab apples, redbuds, forsythia, popcorn spirea. HOLLIES are a concern this year.  The Nellie-R-Stevens were just ready to bloom a couple weeks past when we got hit with a one-night freezing temperature.  The fosteria, savannah, Carissa, oak-leaf,and American hollies have not bloomed yet ( not expected as they follow the Nellie-R's ) TREES: The Crepe Myrtles are leafing out, as are the oaks, maples, sweet-gum, river birch, and bay laurels.\r\nWeekend Public Activities went off well, despite a forecast for rain on Sat. morning ( little rain fell).\r\nWe live \"rural\" and our public water supplied pressure has been extremely low all week.\r\nFire warnings have been made over the past week, due to winds.\r\nOverall - we are concerned that the predicted \"wet spring\" may not happen.  Winds and temperatures have been more an effect than the precipitation.  Temperatures at one point went from 35 degrees to over 86 degrees in less than 12 hours.

Except for piles of snow in parking lots, it's all gone. But the yard is one big wet mess. It will take several days of sun and a good March wind to dry it out. Saw a pond yesterday that has land jutting out, leading to a circular sitting area. The pathway was under water and the sitting area was about half its usual size. I've never seen the water that high in the 25 years I've lived in this area. Hyco Lake reached a high of 411.10 on March 6 but has settled back to 410.83. It has been steadily increasing. As a result the cove is quite muddy in color, a change from when it had a layer of ice and then snow. But that was beautiful to see. Even the main body of the lake had ice on a good portion of it. Not looking forward to my next utility bill. Fortunately we only had brief power outages. Some were without for a day or more while some didn't loose power at all. Other streams, ponds, lakes in adjoining counties are very high Birds are still very active and enjoying the seeds we scattering. Bulbs are popping up and the buds are beginning to swell. With the predicted warm temperatures pops of color should be appearing. Except for grocery stores selling out of bread and milk most stores have suffered because of the winter weather. Garden centers have had a hard time getting shipments as transport across the country was delayed by the weather. Most businesses are saying February was a brutal month in more ways than one. A few hearty souls are still at the campground. Local fishermen must have cabin fever as the lake parking lot was full of trucks with boat trailers. Hope they had good luck as it was a beautiful day. This activity was good for the lake convenience store - its lot was full of vehicles also.  Farmers are saying they are grateful for the snow and increase in the water table but this has put them behind schedule in preparing the fields. Now we all will make up for lost time - meetings postponed, outside activities curtailed.

Thank You Amanda for asking me to be part.\r\nWet Conditions are the problems out here… so close to the outer banks… Humidity and the biological critters that eat and destroy the homes here is a big issue (termites, carpenter ants, carpenter bees, etc.) With all this freezing during winter, the farmers are starting late. The snakes, we have water moccasins here with all these ditches being full and forestry here. They like to get under your house and pull down the insulation for your floor if they can get in. \r\n\r\nMany road projects have been delayed also. The roads are started but the road crews can not get out. Pot holes are everywhere. \r\n\r\nOlder homes have not been cared for so much as the economy has been so depressed for so long. They really don’t have so much on French Drains, Vapor Barriers and stuff as either people don’t know, or they can not afford the newer things to make their homes energy efficient. (Many of the older Contractors too are stuck in wanting to do things the OLD way and not the NEWER way…) Wait until we have a hurricane… People have not and are resistant to retro fitting their homes on newer hurricane standards. One day we will have what the older locals say was Isabel about 15 years ago (I guess) and the wind whipped everything… well now that people can not afford to repair and maintain their homes because of Unemployment with the recession and now the weather… these houses and stuff are more venerable then ever to weather issues. The buildings are collapsing.\r\n\r\nThe other thing is lots of businesses out here (ie farmers, timber/lumber jacks and new starts of home building or restoration and repair) have severely hampered the Employment Base as tradesman and farmers cannot get out in this weather. In some of the areas up to 60% of the males in the census tracts are out of work (18-54 yo males). (US Department of Labor)\r\n\r\nMany Plants around here are confused. My roses are starting to have stuff grow and the daffodils and other plants thought it was time… but then we had this last hard freeze. I am watching to see if the perennial plants will make it.\r\n\r\nTo give you an idea… Story: Dale (my boyfriend) works Industrial/Commercial HVAC. The company he works for is putting a third floor on one of the Sandals Resort Buildings at Duck, NC (close to Kitty Hawk on the outer banks.) Well, they got the roof off in Nov/Dec (other companies part) and then the freeze happened with the rain in December which delayed some things. Went into January and the building was damaged without a way to get the roof back on. B&M Construction, Inc (Electrical and HVAC&R) had to laid off all but 4 of the 35 employees… they are just now going back to work from being unemployed from Mid Jan for 5-7 weeks depending on when they have been called back to work. So it is not only affecting the building industry but the tourist industry too. I have no idea how much money is lost in work? business sales? recreation? farming? AG? Lumber?\r\n\r\nPeople too are getting really depressed as SAD (Seasonal Affective Disorder) has had so many trapped inside their homes. People do not have the cloths for this kind of weather but it has now happened 2 years in a row, unseasonably cold. I will up day you on farming and plant growth.\r\n\r\nAll the ditches around here have had lots of algae and other growth in them since 2014 with all the standing water. Still having this problem. Not so much a problem with mosquitoes last year. \r\n\r\nThe Tractor and Feed Stores are selling chicks and ducks, but with the weather, it is questionable if we can get them outside as Spring may be delayed. \r\n\r\nLots of Cardinals and Blue Jays few Robins (not so much woodpeckers and others. I am not sure of all the species I see but identify what I know.) The Birds are having foraging problems, as well as the Canadian Geese cause the snow and ice. They can not find food.\r\n\r\n\r\nDrought Impact Data: \r\nStartDate: 2015-01-","scalebar":"NA","stationname":"South Mills 0.1 SW","stationnumber":"NC-CA-4","reportdate":"2015-03-05T00:00:00Z","datetimestamp":"2015-03-05T04:31:20Z","creationdate":"2015-03-05T06:31:03Z"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-79.995506,32.755856]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":1086,"categories":"Agriculture","description":"Soil moisture in the vegetable garden, compost, and the general area remains high.\r\n\r\nDrought Impact Data: \r\nStartDate: 2015-02-16\r\nEndDate: 2015-02-22\r\nIs Condition Monitoring Report\r\nCategories: \r\nAgriculture","scalebar":"NA","stationname":"Charleston 2.0 S","stationnumber":"SC-CR-88","reportdate":"2015-02-22T00:00:00Z","datetimestamp":"2015-02-22T05:08:34Z","creationdate":"2015-02-22T07:08:28Z"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.433907,36.115803]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":1087,"categories":"","description":"Received 1.12\" of snow and sleet this week..

The roses got knocked down this week during freezes, so are no longer available to the bees.

It was a soggy, sometimes humid and uncomfortable week.  Grass is growing ( and shooting up seed heads), but the amount of water on the ground makes it impossible to mow.  At this moment, a walk through the yard will bring water up to the top edge of your foot.  Very squishy.  Needless to say, there is standing water in the roadside ditches.  No flooding was reported; although a middle-of-the-night rain storm brought nearly an inch in an hour.  AGRICULTURE: not much activity due to rainy days - Soy Beans are well developed, some cotton was sprayed defoliage so the heads are apparent now;  BLOOMING PLANTS: some magnolia, vitex, abellia, roses, ragweed, golden rod, and grasses.  Leaves are thinning on the crepe myrtles.  Some oaks are showing leaf damage from catepillars.  Snakes are being seen - very healthy big ones - of the copper head variety ..errg! FIRE ANTS - a significant increase in mounds ( after rains, and seasonal brood build up )\r\nNo public events were impacted by any weather event.\r\nBIRDS:  Humming birds are very much decreasing in numbers - within a two week period - we went from feeding nearly 2 gallons a week to over 30 birds, down to maybe 1 quart every two to three days for perhaps a half a dozen birds.  CROWS seem very vociferous these days; blue jay still around; canary finches - population low, but still around; cardinals are stepping up their feeding at the feeders; finches still around as are wrens, mockingbirds, and doves - lots of doves.  Wild turkey are frequently seen in the area. Evidence of plenty of healthy foxes based on the amount of scat found primarily in the middle of the road.\r\nTRAVEL REPORT  - FROM EASTERN NORTH CAROLINA THRU the EASTERN SHORE OF VIRGINIA into the EASTERN SHORE OF MARYLAND:  Northernmost NC had just received several inches of rainfall the day before we drove through there ( stopped at a friend's farm )  They had flooding, but all was drained when we were there.  Virginia - seemed a bit dryer, but not very noticeable.  Maryland, on the other hand, was VERY DRY.  There, they are harvesting their corn; pumpkin foliage was dying ( or dead ) back with bright orange pumpkins in the fields; they are still selling locally grown roadside watermelon and lopes and sweet potatoes; Rainfall predicted for the area skirted it, and they rec'd way less than anticipated during our stay there -there grass is brownish; the farmers were using Reinke irrigation in their fields, their soy is much smaller and less developed than in Eastern NC.   It looked like fall was going to be the next week  - with either sweet gum or maple tree leaves turning colors already.\r\nOur bees are doing well - laying brood for the over-winter period.  We will harvest our honey this week.

Our roadside ditches ( which are about 4 feet deep ) began to dry entirely out - only dark soil without any standing water. \r\nIt was a juggling act to water newly planted items and vegetable garden.  Forecasts for rain were uncertain, and as the week ( and TS ANA ) progressed, forecasts fell short. UNTIL ... Saturday.  In some ways, the storm moving so slowly made the amount of precipitation that did come down a bit easer to take.  The about 4 inches we received here at this location was spread out ( thus far ) over three days.  As I write this, the center of the now Depression is about 100 miles to our north, so we could get some additional precip from it, but the skies are starting to have longer periods of light.\r\nWinds through the storm were their strongest at this location at about 11 pm to midnight on Sunday night 5/10.\r\n\r\nJUST prior to the storm's arrival, our local farmer spread fertilizer and lime on the fields.  We are still not certain what he is planting this year. Rumor says perhaps Sorghum.\r\nPrior to the rain/storm, the bird feeder birds seemed to have slowed down their visits a bit ( although the blue jays started to visit the feeders ).  Now, after the storm, we see that many of the smaller finches are devouring the feed.  // As of this writing, although there are flash flood warnings for our county, we do not see any evidence of concern.// There were numerous outdoor public events locally over the weekend, none ( including ECU grad ceremonies) were cancelled.  Rain, if it came, was short lived.

No shortage of water. Indiana had received over 7\" of rain within a couple of days. Acres and acres of fields around Lexington KY were flooded. Roadside ditches in all states had standing water (and still standing along the road to my house). Runoff was coming through fissures in the roadside rocks creating absolutely beautiful waterfalls. Some flood relief shelters had been opened but that lasted only s short period of time. Going through some national forests signs said fire danger was moderate. But from looking at the ground, it really appeared very low. We would not have been surprised to hear of a fire started by lightning as we saw some very loud and colorful storms. Fields are too wet to work in all the states. Farm and garden activities are definitely behind schedule. There may be a shortage in the winter wheat harvest due to the wet spring. A local golf course admonished golfers to stay on cart paths as the new grass is suffering as it greens up due to the cart wheels. Hyco Lake level is 410.40\" going up slightly after each rain. Fishing activity is strong, garden centers are busy despite wet conditions - gardeners are always optimistic. Campers are returning to the lake campgrounds and from what I heard campsites and parks are very active in the other states.Based on the number of tractor-trailers on the interstates, businesses must be thriving. Birds are very active with migratory birds stopping at our feeders for a nourishing refill.

Conditions likely to be impacted include: numerous water leaks detected in public and private structures. Homes equipped with community water without individual meters making leak or overuse detection difficult. Can see wet areas on sidewalks when it has not been raining. These leaks are icy when the weather is cold and dry. Wildlife (large populations of Canada geese, pets, ducks), human waste, diapers, and obstructed drainage lead to increased fecal coliform bacteria counts and some temporary odors in creeks. Rain storms lead to increased marine debris movement in creeks (logs, balls, sticks). Local authorities unsure of jurisdiction for water issues (county, town, state, federal, upstream, downstream, atmospheric). Volunteer fire departments check on hydrants that may be leaking. Water company changes cleaning agents (ammonium, chlorine, other) periodically. A large number of recreational swimming pools in this area. Golf courses in area that may want to water putting greens for cosmetic appeal. Some neighborhoods resort to artificial colors to make grass appear green for appeal when it is actually brown due to dry conditions. People build campfires nearby. Air quality reports are made daily and small articulate is a baseline problem many days. A power plant may use water reservoir for electricity production. Local farms are already resorting to using their property for recreation rather than agriculture (hay rides, pumpkin patch, seasonal festivals). Recreational water reservoirs are affected by water levels and issues related (affect boat rentals, swimming areas, fishing, ability to eat fish,).   Other issues may become apparent later. The area is diversely populated with people from eastern hemispheres and southern hemispheres so there is a communication barrier for weather related incidents. These cultural differences also lead to mis-understandings about weather conditions even if the hazards are communicated in other dialects. Lack of economic resources make alternative choices difficult (to buy bottled water, stop eating fish, etc.) People are employed in car washes, laundry facilities, power washing, carpet cleaning, and other water dependent occupations. Bottled water is not always a viable alternative due to problems encountered in shipping or processing (may taste bad, inconsistent product quality, subject to sell outs, price ranges from cheap <$1 to expensive >$3 per bottle). Unable to wash clothes and bedding may lead to increased odors and sanitary problems such as dust mites, flea populations, yeast infections and body odor. Reluctance to properly rinse boats and sport equipment after use leads to spread or increase of invasive species in water supply. If people experience general health problems related to drought, they may have difficulty communicating to health care team in native language. May not follow prescriptions due and have to wait for weeks to see doctor again for side effect monitoring or treatment effectiveness assessments. Uninsured or unemployed not able to encounter health care system. Other local business depending on viable water for production and/or distribution here include: coffee shops, micro brews, wineries, soda/other beverage. People use these beverages for relief of thirst and emotional issues. \r\n\r\nDrought Impact Data: \r\nStartDate: 2015-03-24\r\nEndDate: NA\r\nIs Condition Monitoring Report\r\nCategories: ","scalebar":"NA","stationname":"Morrisville 1.5 SSW","stationnumber":"NC-WK-185","reportdate":"2015-03-25T00:00:00Z","datetimestamp":"2015-03-24T04:34:11Z","creationdate":"2015-03-25T06:55:56Z"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-77.232407,35.141027]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":1179,"categories":"Agriculture,Business And Industry,Plants And Wildlife,Tourism And Recreation","description":"weekly report ending Saturday: December 20th\r\nUps and downs in temperatures, more than precipitation, has been the most impactful this past week.

Worse, we are not anticipating any precipitation for at least another week.\r\nin 22 days, we have rec'd only .22 of an inch; prior to that, we received only 1.44 of an inch in one overnight event back about mid-May. \r\nThe tops of our 6 year old long leaf pines are turning brown; our river birch leaves have turned yellow, then brown and are falling off.  Our ditches are bone dry and the dirt has long cracks in it.  Birds continue to seek out any source of water ( the barn swallows use our swimming pool/ the finches use the ant traps on the hummingbird feeders). While in town ( 9 miles away ) the crepe myrtles are blooming, here they are struggling to do so for lack of water. \r\nIn addition to a lack of precipitation, we have had usually about 15 knots of wind, and temps about 92 degrees daily.\r\nWe spend a lot of time and energy attempting to get water to the most needy of the plants.\r\nOur buckwheat crop has started to dry out ( a bit prematurely).

Consequently all symptoms of light to moderate drought have completely disappeared from Oconee and Pickens Counties.  However since our particular station location received much less robust rainfall totals than most, I would have to conclude that \"incipient drought\" still remains in our location and perhaps in a few other \"isolated spots\" in the Upstate as well.

The trees are all leafed out and there is no sign of any leaves turning yellow or dropping off. The wildflowers are in full bloom and the wild blackberries are ripe for the picking. Grass seems to be growing well. The soil is firm but does not appear to be dried out. Wildlife appears to be doing well with several large deer spotted in the woods. The frogs in the ponds are filling the night air with their singing. There were quite a few tourists around over the weekend but they have thinned out considerably so it is now much more peaceful.

Many local news outlets are publicizing the case of amoeba infection in North Carolina that led to early mortality of a young water sport participant. \r\n\r\nDrought Impact Data: \r\nStartDate: 2016-06-30\r\nEndDate: NA\r\nIs Condition Monitoring Report\r\nCategories: Energy\r\nPlants and Wildlife\r\nSociety and Public Health\r\nWater Supply and Quality","scalebar":"NA","stationname":"Morrisville 1.5 SSW","stationnumber":"NC-WK-185","reportdate":"2016-06-30T00:00:00Z","datetimestamp":"2016-06-30T17:31:19Z","creationdate":"2016-06-30T20:32:23Z"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-82.76719,35.98208]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":114,"categories":"Energy,Plants And Wildlife,Water Supply And Quality","description":"The past 9 days have seen 1.21\" of rain, most of it falling in 2 days.

Many are leaning or fallen with brown and green needles. Some maple trees were also seen. The ground is covered mostly in brown pine needles. The trees were affected by the wind (swaying/rustling) but the water at a lower elevation than the trees and ground was stagnant without any signs of recent flow or sediment disturbances. The water itself was clear enough to see the sandy bottom in most places that were devoid of growing green grass/algae/weeds. We had a brief rain shower this afternoon, which was heavy at times. There was green moss growing on the creek bank and hundreds of unclassified small waterborne and airborne insects in continuous motion and/or stirred into motion as we approached. There were isolated patches of darker green algal mats that were growing on the surface on down lower through the water column. The surface water temperature was 63°F, air temperature at eye level after 15 minutes was 69°F in the shade and relative humidity ~50%. I heard a mourning dove calling and other songbirds.

Birds are very active, butterflies abound, leaves getting larger every day. Due to recent rains the lake continues to be muddy in some areas. The level is 410.35'.

I would have thought that the rain would have wet the soil around here somewhat, but I noticed in the garden dirt at work in Augusta only the top quarter of inch of soil was wet, after this quarter of an inch the dirt soil was completely dry.  Here in my backyard in North Augusta, the clay soil has large cracks in it despite the rainfall yesterday.  My husband mowed the grass tonight and again despite the heavy rain yesterday, the mowing stirred up quite the dust storm.  The drier weather has been welcomed to bring the river level down.  The current river level is at 99.13 feet.  The highest height that the river has been this month has been around 105ft.  Since the river has gone down, there are areas now with rocks exposed that have been underwater since the Flood on January 1st.  The once muddy flood waters in January, have now become much clearer, & the water color is now more of a green color which is much prettier compared to the chocolate brown color caused by the flood waters. Rain is in the forecast for Thursday, which is the last day of the month, but with current QPF forecasted, i don't see the area making normal rainfall this month. One other note for this month. The pollen started on March 13th.  The pollen was so thick on some days the week of March 14th-18th you could see a yellow smoggy haze in the afternoon sky.  Thankfully we did get some rainfall to wash the pollen away on March 19th.  0.01\" of pollen collected on top of the water that was collected during the rain that night in the gage.  Since then, the pollen has not been as thick, but it is still collecting on the cars and after yesterday's rain you can see where the pollen collected in puddles and is now all dried up.  Let's hope that April showers will bring our rainfall deficit down and completely was away all of the pollen.\r\n\r\nDrought Impact Data: \r\nStartDate: 2016-03-28\r\nEndDate: NA\r\nIs Condition Monitoring Report\r\nCategories: ","scalebar":"NA","stationname":"North Augusta 4.2 NE","stationnumber":"SC-AK-4","reportdate":"2016-03-28T00:00:00Z","datetimestamp":"2016-03-28T18:36:14Z","creationdate":"2016-03-28T21:36:14Z"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-78.845855,35.814159]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":281,"categories":"Energy,Plants And Wildlife,Water Supply And Quality","description":"Populations of different mosquito species are increasing.

Heavy rains here and across the region upstream caused Lake Thurmond to reach a record level full pool of 336 ft.  On Thursday December 31st the flood gates were opened at the Thurmond Dam.

On New Years morning, we woke up to flooded roads in the neighborhood and some neighbors reported flooding in their basements anywhere from 2-4 ft. Water continued to rise during the day on New Years Day at a rate of one inch per hour.  We started measuring the water rise at 11:30pm and by 6pm almost one foot of water had risen throughout the neighborhood.  Roads flooded even more with this rapid water rise during the day.  Water flooded our backyard and slowly creeped it's way across the side of our yard and filled our driveway across the low spot.  Thankfully the water stopped just before reaching our basement garage. The river crest was 118.3ft.  Thankfully water went down on Saturday January 2nd. Roads in the neighborhood were now passable once the water went down on Jan 2nd.

The flood gates have been open at Thurmond Dam for over a week with the dam gates now coming to a close. Last I heard the flood gates will be completely shut on Monday 1/11/16.  The river has been running at flood stage all week long at 117.5 ft. This level should come down once the Dam flood gates have been shut.  Other areas that have been effected by the high river water here in the area are in North Augusta, river docks behind houses in the River club neighborhood collapsed, the Augusta riverfront marina has been closed due to being underwater, & the Augusta riverwalk has been closed as well due to being underwater.  We had our 1st rainfall of January today. 0.19\" fell. This should not effect the river level too much.  One other note.....The Thurmond dam became a hot tourist spot to watch the flood waters go.  Many people went to the Dam and had their pictures taken with the rushing water coming out of the Dam in the background\r\n\r\nDrought Impact Data: \r\nStartDate: 2016-01-08\r\nEndDate: NA\r\nIs Condition Monitoring Report\r\nCategories: ","scalebar":"NA","stationname":"North Augusta 4.2 NE","stationnumber":"SC-AK-4","reportdate":"2016-01-08T00:00:00Z","datetimestamp":"2016-01-08T13:18:14Z","creationdate":"2016-01-08T15:18:12Z"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-78.845855,35.814159]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":448,"categories":"Plants And Wildlife","description":"Wildlife spotted near creeks/bridges before sunrise today include a large grey fox carefully crossing a four lane street and a dead opossum on the curb. \r\n\r\nDrought Impact Data: \r\nStartDate: 2015-12-13\r\nEndDate: NA\r\nIs Condition Monitoring Report\r\nCategories: \r\nPlants and Wildlife","scalebar":"NA","stationname":"Morrisville 1.5 SSW","stationnumber":"NC-WK-185","reportdate":"2015-12-13T00:00:00Z","datetimestamp":"2015-12-13T13:03:46Z","creationdate":"2015-12-13T15:03:44Z"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-82.76719,35.98208]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":408,"categories":"Energy,Plants And Wildlife,Tourism And Recreation,Water Supply And Quality","description":"Since my last report Dec. 27, we've only had .19\" of precip--mostly dry and cold.

Even though we have not had that much precipitation, the ground surface is not drying out. Many areas remain \"squishy\" when walked upon; ditches retain water in the basins.\r\nAGRICULUTRE: So, this week, much to this rural  neighborhood's surprise, a local farmer had contacted the correct folks and blew up a beaver dam.  It was quite an explosion; and the water running in and through the ditches towards the creek ( and ultimately the river ) was deep and swift flowing.\r\nBEAVERS are beginning to be quite a problem in the immediate area. Their ponds, a result of their dams; are beginning to encroach upon more major roadways.  We suspect that more dam removal by explosion will be in the future.\r\nThese beaver dams also cause the water to stand in ditches; which over the course of the last summer, caused the mosquito population to be serious.\r\nOther than that - agriculture in the immediate vicinity has not done anything over the past week.\r\nLOGGING:  It seems that this is their season.  A LOT of logging is going on locally.  We have not seen any evidence of replanting the previous year's logging.  This is a concern for wind block / soil erosion and more. ( and of course, wildlife refuge )\r\nENERGY:  the temperatures swung widely this week - going from quite warm ( approaching hot.. upper 70's ) to quite cool ( highs not making it in to the 50'); so a/c and heaters were run, probably not in earnest, but still had to be run daily.\r\nPLANTS: As of last week, some plants were blooming that otherwise would not have: Shasta daisy / daffodils are starting to show through the ground / roses are blooming / dandelions and a smattering of others.\r\nWILDLIFE:  It is bear hunting season, so animals are sometimes seen moving around that might otherwise remain undetected.  ( the use dogs to hunt which scatters all critters)\r\nThe rain of this past week mostly was on one day, which if you had to be out would have been uncomfortable, but in no way would have impacted business.  It was mid-week, so outdoor events, normally scheduled on weekends, were not adversely impacted.\r\nWATER LEVELS RIVERS: remain on the high side of normal\r\nTOURISM:  We live near a tourist destination, and with the holidays, it is busier locally - but no weather event has impacted tourism.\r\nWinds have been higher - which normally impacts Fire Danger- but the ground surface remains wet, so the fire danger level has remained low.\r\n\r\nDrought Impact Data: \r\nStartDate: 2015-12-20\r\nEndDate: NA\r\nIs Condition Monitoring Report\r\nCategories: \r\nAgricultureEnergyFire\r\nPlants and Wildlife\r\nSociety and Public Health\r\nTourism and Recreation","scalebar":"NA","stationname":"New Bern 8.8 W","stationnumber":"NC-CN-31","reportdate":"2015-12-20T00:00:00Z","datetimestamp":"2015-12-20T05:14:52Z","creationdate":"2015-12-20T07:14:50Z"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-79.995506,32.755856]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":439,"categories":"Agriculture,Plants And Wildlife","description":"The soil in the vegetable garden and the general area remains very wet.

On one occasion the deer ran in circles and startled the great blue heron into screeching/grunting flight from the shallow waters where he/she has been seen standing in the morning. \r\n\r\nDrought Impact Data: \r\nStartDate: 2015-12-01\r\nEndDate: NA\r\nIs Condition Monitoring Report\r\nCategories: \r\nPlants and Wildlife","scalebar":"NA","stationname":"Morrisville 1.5 SSW","stationnumber":"NC-WK-185","reportdate":"2015-12-01T00:00:00Z","datetimestamp":"2015-12-01T16:19:16Z","creationdate":"2015-12-01T18:20:21Z"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-82.76719,35.98208]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":465,"categories":"Energy,Plants And Wildlife,Water Supply And Quality","description":"Today we recorded 1.65\" of rain and it's still raining.

Air quality is forecast in this metropolitan area, but not in all areas. If the pollutant is smoke from combustion, then it follows carbon monoxide will be produced as well. Smoke rises or is suspended or transported by wind. Carbon monoxide is odorless and heavier than air so it seeks lowest ground. If particulate is dust, then the properties of the dust will affect certain populations (trees, pollens, ashes, asbestos, molds, etc.) These microscopic pollutants cause: mucosal irritation; vascular dilation or constriction; central nervous system issues; and others. Affects may be acute, chronic and cumulative. Carbon monoxide may seek path of least resistance and flow downhill/downstream within river banks all the way to the lowest elevation sea level at the coast. One implication for drought is that, after a rain, some of these pollutants may be transported from the atmosphere to the water. Many times I see \"code green\" better air quality following a rain.

On closer inspection, the tree is nearly horizontal to the ground near a parking lot, but the leaves are still very green except for one small fractured limb with brown leaves distal to the fracture. The tree is apparently rooted even though it looks nearly horizontally fallen. It is not prudent to venture to inspect the root/low trunk structure due to the location and steep incline. \r\n\r\nDrought Impact Data: \r\nStartDate: 2015-11-05\r\nEndDate: NA\r\nIs Condition Monitoring Report\r\nCategories: \r\nPlants and Wildlife\r\nWater Supply and Quality","scalebar":"NA","stationname":"Morrisville 1.5 SSW","stationnumber":"NC-WK-185","reportdate":"2015-11-20T00:00:00Z","datetimestamp":"2015-11-05T08:58:32Z","creationdate":"2015-11-20T14:49:43Z"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-78.845855,35.814159]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":486,"categories":"Plants And Wildlife,Water Supply And Quality","description":"At a local creek this morning surface water temperature was 58 F.

Surface leaves floating were moving 4 feet in less than 3 seconds. The water temperature was 68 degrees. Using a 1/2 cup plastic cup and a household electric meter, I measured the DC voltage and resistance of water here. As a control, I measured 1/2 cup bottled water, diet soda, rain water, (with baking soda or table salt added) indoors. Resistance of the water samples were different and usually in the 2,000 Ohm range. Voltage among samples varied, mostly in the 200 millivolt DC range (+,-). The properties of the creek water steadily varied as soon as the water was removed from the creek, unlike the other samples, which were fairly stable. The method should be refined before numbers reported. The hypothesis is that the electrolyte properties of water will vary with the solution, temperature, mixing, 1/2 life, and other variables. The ingredients of creek water are largely unknown, unlike the other samples.

Soybeen corp did not grow as tall either. \r\n\r\nInteresting that many of these old houses have the appearences of being in better shape then they are because they used vinyl siding with aluminum trim. How ever the caulking over the years is not kept up, and that wind damage occurs as the siding becomes brittle from being baked in the sun since some where in the 90s. You can not get the right pieces either to just go fix it. So, we noticed a small maybe the size of a silver dollar hole between the storm window and regular window. (That was the only visable symptom) however we got the trim molding cover off (this is a bay window that is 12x7 feet behind a exterior wall.) Well it was rotted all the way down to the foundation of the ground. Mind you, it was not infested with vectors like carpenter ants, or termites. This is just moisture trapped causing wood rooting along edges of wood severly. They would have been better off, neve having put that stuff on. It would have been noticed faster. Needless the hugh air leak for HVAC/heat or cooling.It has taken 3 weeks to rebuild the wall with 2 carpenters working at it. We only have the bay window roof to replace now.\r\n\r\n2 coats of gripper prime coat, and two coats of color trim... with lots of caulk inbetwen the seal plates, window casements and alike. It will not be recovered with aluminum either. Talked to some local carpenter in this are, many homes are having these issues and they are not being readily discovered.This is where housing construction and weather meet, and the people who are having these issues are not even able to see the damage before buying and lots of these old homes are very old. We are have discovered a different problem under the vinyl siding itself in a nother area, will get tell you once we have a way to tear it apart. I do not even know how to assess the impact of this. Some people -not so many- are actually taking this vinyl siding off and dealing with structural issues.\r\n\r\n\r\nDrought Impact Data: \r\nStartDate: 2015-11-03\r\nEndDate: NA\r\nIs Condition Monitoring Report\r\nCategories: ","scalebar":"NA","stationname":"South Mills 0.1 SW","stationnumber":"NC-CA-4","reportdate":"2015-11-03T00:00:00Z","datetimestamp":"2015-11-03T04:00:31Z","creationdate":"2015-11-03T06:00:31Z"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-78.845855,35.814159]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":518,"categories":"Plants And Wildlife,Water Supply And Quality","description":"location: N 35-48.890 W 078-50.764 at Nov 2 12:53:22 UTC: ditch water at this location was 64 degrees and quickly flowing.

For whatever reason the water was 9 degrees warmer than the air at that time, the drought implication would be the thermal energy that raised the water temperature while it was flowing would be much more concentrated if it were released in less water. Water temperature in turn affects biologic cycles (spawning, circadian, migrating, reproducing, etc.)and therefore has impact on local and downstream organisms. The distance between the water surface and the footbridge measured 8 feet yesterday afternoon and was estimated the same today. During low water, the creek at this site has been dry or stagnant.

Few wildflowers remain, but bees are enjoying our late chrysanthemums. Coyotes have been common on the wildlife camera, along with opossums, raccoons, and wild turkeys.

The long snake was copper/orange/gold colored and had repetitive finger like blotches that grew progressively smaller and closer together from the head to tail.

Hundreds of thousands lost in each area with millions totaled. Thanks to irrigation we had some good strawberries and blueberries but at a big cost to the farmers. Our corn crop was all but destroyed with exceptions of some small irrigated plots. Wildlife has been seen coming out into more dangerous areas for them to get water, especially deer, raccoons, rabbits, opossoms and snakes. Our main water source in Rowan County is the Yadkin/PeeDee River and has been effected but not significantly due to the Mountain areas getting good rainfall during this time which feeds the Yadkin.

About 140 feet of our wood fencing, which consists of of treated wood, made of 4-by-4 inch posts with three horizontally parallel straight-cut wood planks between every two sets of posts (the total height of the fence above ground is between four to five feet), has enough moisture removed from the soil and fence posts that there is a gap all around the 4-by-4 posts, allowing the fence face as a whole to wobble back and forth.  The gaps around the posts are perhaps a quarter of an inch or so all the way around, and I haven't yet looked at all of our fencing, which totals about just under one half of a mile.  Some poles have been wobbly before at various times of the year, but not this many all at once, all in a row at the same time.  This is an old fence, at least a dozen years old.

With evaporation the humidity is very high. Found out that if people are using R-410 Regrerant in AC units, and the CF/m on AC is not ballanced right, humidity is NOT condensed and removed as it should hand houses build up humidity inside. With all the other problems of humidity, the HVAC people in Eastern NC are really not wekk edycated in this and the damage from high mosture content supports biologics so carpenter ants and termite damage is more likely. My husband just took a class on it and I had been complaining on the humidity levels (he had been down playing me until the class he took on Friday.) OUr inside house humidity has been running 65-70 % thus you have to run your AC unit into lower tempuratures to achieve reduction in the cooling of AC. (This is weather interplaying in lots of old houses here in this area) JUst FYI. The conclusion is that R 410 refrigerant is much more touchy comared to AC that uses other refrigerants.

My personal observations are that many of the crops are burning at the edges of their leafs, even with twice a day irrigation in private setings. Not so in public farms. I know of one actual case of a HVAC refrigeration technician fainting during the heat while repairing a AC unit on a Doller General. The roof was flat and tar... 6/16. His employer chose to fire him as he was in the probation period of his employment. He got off the roof safely (as he had no partner to check on him) but it took a lot of rehydration of Pedilyte about 1.5 gal over the course of 18 hours (without regard to all the water he had drank before he fainted. He was a very seasoned commercial and industral HVAC installer/repair technician. However he did not go to the hospital (as many men do not) so it will not show up as a reported incident except here. The poverty here, is such... other construction workers are subject to the same. It is a shame they do not implement what in many south Texas areas on the Gulf Coast do during heat conditions like this - which is to stop work when the temp reaches so high, and they return to work maybe 5-6 pm as the sun is much higher on their horizon... a second suggestion is to start construction on road work and other asphault/ or construction when possible at 10 pm and work until 6-8 am and this provides a much cooler environment using work construction grade lighting sources... this would not work for all trades but much of the road work could be done that way. \r\n\r\nNo real working knowledge on what to do for HVAC Refrigeration techs on hot roofs... we have so many commercial and industral buildings that can not shut down when the AC goes out... it has to be fixed, but I wonder if the industry could barrow some ideas from the fire fighters gear for such work?\r\n\r\nThe rain and cool weather this AM is a great blessing... the plants that were showing heat damage to thier leave edges... perked up with this burst of rain and cooler weather this am.

I have 5 tempurature devices and the local forcast for South Mills is at an AirPort in Chesapeake, VA or Coast Guard Base in Elizabeth City, NC located on the sound. Both areas get a significant cooling effect from the water and breeze coming off... but in this area of NC, much of this area is trees (the lumber industry is here for over 200+ years) and the trees are 80 ft tall. Much of the area is forested or spotty farms as they have to clear dense tree stumps for farm land here.... thus we do not get the breeze... Point: OUR Tempurature here is at least 10 degrees hotter in the summer and yesterday it was 18 degrees hotter. The meteorologist all but called me a lier. He said my instruments were not accurate, but 5 seperate devices... one NOAA authorized, 2 manual tempurature gauges, and 2 different vehicles parked with readings all reading the same are not wrong.

The woods are very dry; a lot of dry leaf litter which means we have a high wild fire risk.  Our springs are barely flowing. Usually they flow at several gallons per minute. The meadow creek is almost dry; it should be flowing strongly. We have noticed that deer & other wildlife are watering at the few pools that still have enough water to drink.  We are having to hand-water our garden just to keep the young plants alive.

I was working in the yard, took a step and started sinking. Great for the water table. Streams, rivers and ponds are at or above normal levels. Since my last report, Hyco Lake rose briefly but has settled back to 410.39'. Some days the lake is so still it looks like a mirror, so beautiful. There are still quite a few fishermen on the lake and campers are returning to the recreation area. Birds are still around, quantities not as large as in past years, but a good variety. As I write this there are 11 different ones at our feeders plus the usual squirrels and chipmunks. Everything appears to have gone dormant, about time for winter pruning. Hellebores are beginning to bloom, providing a little winter color. Still waiting for a big snow!\r\n\r\nDrought Impact Data: \r\nStartDate: 2015-01-24\r\nEndDate: NA\r\nIs Condition Monitoring Report\r\nCategories: \r\nAgriculture\r\nBusiness and Industry\r\nPlants and Wildlife\r\nTourism and Recreation\r\nWater Supply and Quality","scalebar":"NA","stationname":"Hyco","stationnumber":"NC-CS-1","reportdate":"2015-01-24T00:00:00Z","datetimestamp":"2015-01-24T10:35:44Z","creationdate":"2015-01-24T12:34:51Z"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-78.8188,35.7269]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":1129,"categories":"","description":"With over 4\" of rain for the month to date, it is wet.

At night it beautifully reflects the Christmas decorations set on docks. There are still plenty of campers at the recreation area. They have even decorated with stringing lights on the fence. Some die-hard fishermen have been dropping lines into the lake from the shore and boats - hope they are having good luck. The major influx of winter birds has not occurred yet but the seed in our feeders and the suet is disappearing on a steady basis. Sasanguas are steadily blooming, providing some color. Nandinas, pyracanthas and hollies are producing plenty of berries - ample for decorations and food for the birds. There are still plenty of leaves and acorns are on the ground, slowly but surely getting leaves into flower beds or compost bins. Worm bins are in their winter locations and their activity is slowing down. fields are barren but are still beautiful, just waiting for snow!

Many areas around my home where I observe have reported much more rainfall than here.  In August my total rainfall was 2.07\"  in September my total rainfall was a little bit more compared to August 2.59\" total rainfall.  Normal rainfall for August is 4.32\" & Normal rainfall for September is 3.22\"  This puts my deficit for the two months at -2.88\"  There were about 8 days of observed precipitation in August, & there were 18 days of observed precipitation in September.  I know 18 days of measured rainfall seems like a lot, but the amount of rain that fell on each of these days was not very much.  Each day that I measured rainfall during September, it usually was less than a tenth of an inch.  Some things I have noticed in regards to the dry weather.  Savannah river is very low right now.  Many rocks are exposed out of the water near the bridge that crosses the river on I-20.  Pine trees are dropping needles like crazy here in and around my neighborhood. You can look up in the pine trees and see all the brown needles mixed with the green needles.  Many have been out mowing grass and preforming landscaping chores since the sun has come out the past two days.  (we had a week straight of cloudy cool weather with below average temperatures sept 23rd-29th)  I noticed a lot of dust in the air while folks were mowing.  One final note for this observation is that tree leaves are starting to show some fall color.  Tree leaves are not as bright green as they were back in August.  Finally, the traveling rain gage went to Road Atlanta in Braselton, Georgia twice in August.  Both race events saw some rainfall.  Rainfall for the 1st even at the beginning of the month was just a trace, & for the 2nd event later in the month, there was some heavy rain that fell during one night of the event that dropped 0.85\" of rain.\r\n\r\nDrought Impact Data: \r\nStartDate: 2014-08-01\r\nEndDate: NA\r\nIs Condition Monitoring Report\r\nCategories: ","scalebar":"NA","stationname":"North Augusta 4.2 NE","stationnumber":"SC-AK-4","reportdate":"2014-10-01T00:00:00Z","datetimestamp":"2014-10-01T12:18:26Z","creationdate":"2014-10-01T15:18:25Z"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-80.838,32.328]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":1324,"categories":"Plants And Wildlife","description":"In September we had a total of 7.89 inches of rain, with only 7 days in the month having no precipitation.

It rained 16 out of 31 days plus we had a trace on an additional day.  Although I have no records of rainfall in prior years, from my recollection, this is the wettest July I can recall in recent years.  The ground in our community is very saturated.  When we walked today (August 2 after another .60 inches of rain in the overnight hours), I observed a great deal of lying water in the grassy areas alongside the roadway.  Many yards, drainage ditches and undeveloped lots had substantial lying water. One low-lying lot near my home often has standing water in the center of the lot during wet seasons; what was highly unusual is that today  I observed almost the entire lot covered with standing water, including the edges of the lot. When my husband spotted a Chinese tallow sapling (approximately five feet tall) in a neighbor's yard, I decided to gently tug at it to see if I could pull it out.  The tallow easily came out with the root system, which was every bit of 10-12 inches long, moist and intact.  Generally, saplings this tall have to be cut and sprayed, so the fact it came out easily indicates that the soil is saturated at least that deep in the ground.

In surveying other reoprots, low country patterns continue; one instrument near Ridgeland, SC, fewer than 20 km away, registered only .16\" and one less than 5 km. from here registered zero. But it all helps.\r\nWe have a large number of man-made lagoons in our community, all connected together but large pipes underground. As a result they share rainfall and are controlled to maintain a given level, so using them to estimate drought status can be tricky. However, for a few weeks, they had all been low. An indication of too little rainfall, but it turned out they had been lowered due to the new construction of additional lagoons in new parts of the development.

We are currently several inches below normal precip. levels.  Without regular bouts of precip., changes in \"normal\" plant growth & hydrologic activity has been noted. NOW, in  late June 2014, the cumulative effect is becoming clear.  Our springs and our creek are dried up as of late June 2014. In a year of \"average\" precip., we maintain some flow throughout the summer.  Plant growth, both native and planted, has been off & on. Mostly \"off\". Plants emerge but then seem to freeze in their growth development.   Plants are much smaller and insect pests seem to be taking a greater toll in the absence of precip. to trigger plant growth.  Trying to gauge, to measure this is difficult but after many years of observation, experience, I see us slipping slowly into a drought situation.  For example:  our apples & nut trees usually gradually produce fruits that are slowly growing, increasing in size.  What I am now seeing is trees shedding fruits (drops) and the ends of branches turning brown and shriveling up.   When usually healthy leafed branches die, you might suspect disease or fungus. My judgement is that I am seeing the slow effects of irregular precip. and overall shortage of moisture.  Based on what I see in late June, the late summer, early fall harvests will be reduced.     \r\n\r\nDrought Impact Data: \r\nStartDate: 2014-01-01\r\nEndDate: NA\r\nIs Condition Monitoring Report\r\nCategories: \r\nAgriculture\r\nPlants and Wildlife\r\nWater Supply and Quality","scalebar":"NA","stationname":"Bakersville 2.5 SE","stationnumber":"NC-ML-2","reportdate":"2014-06-23T00:00:00Z","datetimestamp":"2014-06-23T14:26:25Z","creationdate":"2014-06-23T17:26:25Z"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-82.293985,35.652477]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":1543,"categories":"Agriculture,Tourism And Recreation","description":"Brief pop-up thunderstorms are keeping it from being parched.

We had a big ice/sleet event February 12th.  This particular storm system came in 3 waves of precipitation.  The 1st wave of energy crossed the region on Tuesday February 11th with precipitation falling mainly as rain.  The rain ended, then early Wednesday morning on February 12th we got 1 1/2\" of a combination of freezing rain and sleet.  At this point there was more sleet pellets than freezing rain.  The sleet/ice mix ended in the afternoon on Wednesday, then Wednesday night, the 3rd wave of precipitation came through and brought an additional 1/2\" of freezing rain.  This brought my total sleet/ice accumulation for this weather event up to 2.0\" total. Many medium to large size  Trees tumbled & crashed to the ground under the weight of the ice accumulation.  Power lines fell as well, and here at my house we went 3 days without electricity.  There was no tree damage in my yard, but many of my neighbors yards were covered in downed trees and tree limbs on THursday morning February 13th.  During the 3rd wave it was tough to sleep listening to all the tree limbs crack and crash to the ground.  It got cold inside the house without any heat too…. the inside temperature dropped to 54 degrees on the thermometer.  There was damage to many cars when trees crashed on them and some people had their roofs damaged as trees crashed down on their houses during this time.  As if the ice storm was not bad enough, we then had the earthquake on Friday February 14th.  No damage to report from this.  Just frazzled nerves across the neighborhood.  There was another after shock that was felt on Sunday February 16th.  You can tell that the ice storm damaged all of the trees around here, because when you look up to the top of the trees the trees are either bent or you can see where limbs cracked off.    I honestly think that the damage from this ice storm was worse than any damage that I saw in south Florida from Hurricane Andrew back in 1992.  \r\nMy highest temperature recorded this month was last week on Thursday February 20th. the temperature was 81 degrees.  My lowest temperature recorded was 17 degrees and that was earlier in the month around the 1st.  February 15th and 16th was race weekend.  It was our 1st race event of the season.  When we arrived at Barber in Leeds, Alabama I set my traveling gage out knowing it was going to rain and the gage collected 0.51\" of rain. \r\n Let's hope all the winter weather is done for good for the year for our region.

The month started out very rainy and wet, then the faucet turned off and plants dried up and turned brown as we shivered in the COLD temperatures.  We ended the month with SNOW!  My total rainfall to report for the month is 3.59\"  This is actually below average. Average rainfall is 3.91\" for the Month.  Heaviest rainfall occurred on Saturday January 10th 1.72\" fell during the afternoon with a thunderstorm.  Ironically, I remembered the old wives tale of thunder/lightning in January means snow in 10 days…Well, it was a little more than ten days after I heard that rumble of thunder, and it did snow.  In fact I measured exactly 2 inches.  When all that snow melted down into my gage the total melted snowfall was 0.23\"  The snowfall began around 8pm on 1/28 and lasted through the night into 1/29.  the snow was on the ground for about about 2 days before it all melted away.  I did notice the birds were very active in the morning the day before the snowfall in my backyard.  My daughter brought this to my attention.  I think we saw a red cardinal, a few finches, and some blue jays.  Maybe the birds new what was ahead?  Did I mention it was COLD??????? My lowest temperature reading was 15 degrees.  I cannot remember what day that was.  IF I remember correctly, the day we had the snow on the ground 1/29, the high temperature was only 31 degrees at the airport.  This was a new record low max temperature for that date.  Just in case you were wondering when the last time it snowed here, it was in January back in 2011.  I have plenty of pictures from snowfall January 2011 and January 2014.  My daughter had a blast….Me not so much, it was a big inconvenience & TOO COLD for my taste.  Total days of measured precipitation this month with rain & snow was 12 days.  Kinda shocking that we did not meet average precipitation even with 12 days of measured precipitation.  Currently you can see a picture of my backyard pond with the snowfall on the ground as the cover photo on the NWS Facebook site. Very pretty, worth a look.  Finally, my husband planted rye grass back in the fall with hopes of a pretty green lawn throughout the winter……..rye grass is just as dead as can be, it did grow, grass was green, but it just could not survive the frigid cold temperatures in the teens.  Sago plants were green, now they are brown, palmetto palm fronds still are green, but they have a brownish/yellowish tint to them because of the cold temperatures.  Hope this report is useful.\r\n\r\nDrought Impact Data: \r\nStartDate: 2014-02-01\r\nEndDate: NA\r\nIs Condition Monitoring Report\r\nCategories: ","scalebar":"NA","stationname":"North Augusta 4.2 NE","stationnumber":"SC-AK-4","reportdate":"2014-02-01T00:00:00Z","datetimestamp":"2014-02-01T19:42:24Z","creationdate":"2014-02-01T21:42:24Z"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-82.56778,34.81283]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":1817,"categories":"Agriculture","description":"Soil moisture is a little above normal due to melting snowfall.
