Birds seen and heard in the peri dawn hours today include: geese, dove, crows/blackbirds, songbirds, woodpecker, hawks. The recent rainstorm resulted in redistribution of curbside matter including pine straw, drink containers and leaves. Some grates were 80 to 95% obstructed with 6 inch high accumulations of fresh pine straw. Two typical pine straw samples measured 6 to 7.5 inches long, terminal dark colored hub measured 0.5 inches long. The straw appeared crayola \"burnt sienna\", \"tan\", \"tumbleweed\", \"desert sand\" colored and did not have a strong odor of decomposition or decay. Crickets chirping at slightly different tempos and pitches were abundant this morning. // There were no signs of wind damage or flooding, but there were some curbside piles of tree limbs and branches cut, broken, or sawed from weekend yard work. Yesterday I observed 5 to 10 yards using sprinklers prior to 5 AM. This morning, on a different route, there were two yards using sprinklers after 6 AM. edit 8:30 PM water quality..the faucet mounted water filter was changed today pursuant to the color coded change indicator after approximately 100 gallons filtered. Using color coded qualitative test strips for swimming pools, water was sampled and tested from the old filter, the new filter and another unfiltered faucet. The dry, new filter weighed 5 ounces, the old filter weighed 8.7 ounces (wet). Weight of old used filter will be repeated after >48 hours drying time to estimate particulate removed from tap water. Results of tests in order 1) used filter 2) new filter and 3) unfiltered residential water 8/28/2016 evening. HARDNESS: very low, very low & very low CHLORINE: ideal, low, & ideal to high. FREE CHLORINE: low, low & low. pH: 7.0 +/- 0.2, >8.4 & 7.0 +/-0.2. ALKALINITY: very low to low, low to OK, & low to OK. comments: the filter is meant to improve drinking water in far more ways than this simple qualitative test. This test does demonstrate that there are significant differences between residential tap water from a new filter, an old filter, and unfiltered outlets, most notable in the pH and chlorine categories. These simple results do not attempt to argue a better or worse water supply or quality, but demonstrate arguably different water supply and quality on different days/times with and without new and used filters.   \r\n\r\nDrought Impact Data: \r\nStartDate: 2016-08-28\r\nEndDate: NA\r\nIs Condition Monitoring Report\r\nCategories: \r\nBusiness and Industry\r\nPlants and Wildlife\r\nWater Supply and Quality", "creationDate":"2016-08-28T20:41:24", "dateTimeStamp":"2016-08-28T04:36:53", "categories": "Business And Industry,Plants And Wildlife,Water Supply And Quality"}

The winged bugs measured 1.5 inches anterior to posterior thoracic segment with wings extending an additional 0.5 inch for a total lentgh of 2 inches. The undersides were mostly bright white. There were narrow green streaks bilaterally where the wings attach to the thoracic segments. I saw one bat circling a streetlamp near the creek. I saw and heard three hawks on the ground and in flight. I saw two separate areas, > 1 mile apart, where 3 or more modern streetlamps were not on and coincidentally or causative also had very wet sidewalks, obstructed curbside storm drain grates, and automated water lawn sprinklers. These issues affect the supply/demand/maintenance/repair of all who utilize or pay for utility services ($). I saw more than 10 people walking/jogging/cycling in the morning darkness, although some may have been the same people making rounds around the block, it is difficult to discern in the dark. (recreational sidewalk usage during day and night is the point) . The creek water appears quite stagnant this morning with a dull film or sheen that was previously noted and continues to increase in size due to lack of recent creek flow to wash or rinse the organic sheen of unknown origin (leaf decay/spill/decomposing deceased animal/seepage from underground/other), downstream.edited 8/28/2016 afternoon:: today this sheen and film is completely washed away, apparently by the thunderstorms of last night. The water is shallow, clear and slowly flowing. Less than 20 small minnows (<2 inches long, multi colored) were observed treading water without making headway up or downstream. A large rectangular piece of trash resembling a cooler box top (~2 to 4 square feet area) is washed up on a sandbar.   PLANTS: although much of the foliage remains green, a particular type of tree in a residential yard was observed today to have freshly fallen, brown, dry, crispy, brittle leaves. The tree circumference measures 28 inches and 29 inches at eye level. One larger ground level trunk splits into the two smaller trunks. The tree is approximately as tall as the one story residence rooftop apex is high. A representative leaf measured 3 inches long, was teardrop shaped, 2.5 inches wide at the widest and had a stem one inch long. Best crayola color match was \"tan\" on one side and \"tumbleweed\" on the obverse side. (many are smaller, a few are larger). I tossed a ring of 8 inch inner diameter (a stove top burner ring) six times from over/behind my shoulder while near the trunk and counted the dry leaves within the ring. RESULTS: 17 leaves;77 leaves;24 leaves;26 leaves;16 leaves and 19 leaves. The tree bark is a paper thin type and partially peeled from the tree trunk. Even in the few minutes I was counting leaves the gentle breeze caused a few leaves to fall in sight during the count at around 10 AM. \r\n\r\nDrought Impact Data: \r\nStartDate: 2016-08-23\r\nEndDate: NA\r\nIs Condition Monitoring Report\r\nCategories: Energy\r\nPlants and Wildlife\r\nSociety and Public Health\r\nTourism and Recreation\r\nWater Supply and Quality", "creationDate":"2016-08-28T13:42:27", "dateTimeStamp":"2016-08-23T05:15:28", "categories": "Energy,Plants And Wildlife,Society And Public Health,Tourism And Recreation,Water Supply And Quality"}

But I think this was a bit of an anomaly for our station (and perhaps a few others) in the greater upstate SC based on CoCoRaHS data and radar loop analysis.  Consequently all symptoms of light to moderate drought have completely disappeared from Oconee and Pickens Counties.  However since our particular station location received much less robust rainfall totals than most, I would have to conclude that \"incipient drought\" still remains in our location and perhaps in a few other \"isolated spots\" in the Upstate as well.  To underscore this, our calendar year-to-date rainfall as of August 23 is the lowest since I have been keeping records (since 2003).
